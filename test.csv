c0f722661,USA,3rd,"I’ve just checked the train times for Tuesday next week and I’ve found a train from Derby to Edinburgh that takes about four and a half hours. Well, four hours and twenty-three minutes to be precise. It leaves Derby at 9.16 in the morning and gets into Edinburgh at 13.39. You have to change once, at Newcastle. It gets into Newcastle at 11.52 and leaves at 12.01. The train to Newcastle is run by Virgin Trains and the train you get from Newcastle to Edinburgh is run by GNER. There is a faster service but it leaves Derby later in the morning – at 10.14 – and you have to change at Darlington. It gets into Darlington Station at 12.14 and then you’ve got a seven-minute wait before your next train leaves. It gets into Edinburgh at 14.21. If you get the first train I can meet you at two o’clock. My sister and her friend never finish work until half past two so they can only come with me to meet you if you get a later train. Let me know which train you’re coming on. If you want to come later just let me know. I’ll be in tonight until half eight-ish, then I’m going out with Michelle. Or you could give me a ring tomorrow night. I’ll be at my mum’s, on 0131 600 46220. I’m going there after work, so ring me any time after about quarter past six and you should catch me there. Oh yes, the number to find out train times is, er, 08457 484950. You could always give them a ring yourself and find out about a different
time."
f0953f0a5,USA,3rd,"Well, I was nervous before it started. There were eight of us altogether, including the teacher. My teacher’s name is Charlotte. She’s only been working there for two months. She used to teach in Spain. The first thing we did was stand in a circle and we had to try to learn everybody’s name, age and where they come from. I don’t know if I can remember all of them, but I’ll try. There was someone called Alexandre. He’s from Portugal too and he’s 23. No, he was 24. There was Mohammad, from Kirkuk in Iraq. He’s 30 – two years older than me. There were two other women – Hélène and Yui-Gui. Hélène’s 38 and comes from France. She was a bit loud and I didn’t talk to her much. Yui-Gui was really nice. We worked together – she was my
partner for some of the lesson. She’s from China and used to live in Beijing before she moved to England. She’s 41 years old and married with two children. Patrick came half an hour late. He’s 57 and comes from Eritrea in Africa. Charlotte said that he’s got to come on time if he wants to stay in the class. The other student was Kamal. He was very quiet and didn’t want to tell anyone his age, but I asked him at break-time; he told me that he’s 29. He’s from Afghanistan."
0df072751,India,12th,"Presently, the landlords learned that Germany had developed synthetic indigo. They, thereupon, obtained agreements from the sharecroppers to pay them
compensation for being released from the 15 per cent arrangement. The sharecropping arrangement was irksome to the peasants, and many signed willingly. Those who resisted, engaged lawyers; the landlords hired thugs. Meanwhile, the information about synthetic indigo reached the illiterate peasants who had signed, and they wanted their money back. At this point Gandhi arrived in Champaran. He began by trying to get the facts. First he  visited the secretary of the British landlord’s association. The secretary told him that they could give no information to an outsider. Gandhi answered that he was no outsider."
04caf4e0c,India,12th,"The official inquiry assembled a crushing mountain of evidence against the big planters, and when they saw this they agreed, in principle, to make refunds to the peasants. “But how much must we pay?” they asked Gandhi. They thought he would demand repayment in full of the money which they had illegally and deceitfully extorted from the sharecroppers. He asked only 50 per cent. “There he seemed adamant,” writes Reverend J. Z. Hodge, a  British missionary in Champaran who observed the entire episode at close range. “Thinking probably that he would not give way, the representative of the planters offered to refund to the extent of 25 per cent, and to his amazement Mr. Gandhi took him at his word, thus breaking the deadlock.”
This settlement was adopted unanimously by the commission. Gandhi explained that the amount of the refund was less important than the fact that the landlords had been obliged to surrender part of the money and, with it, part of their prestige."
9612545c0,India,6th,"But the rattlesnake, or ‘rattler’ as it is sometimes called, prefers to avoid people if it possibly can. It holds its tail upright and rattles the end whenever it is disturbed, in the hope that the intruder will go away. However, if its warnings are ignored—and it feels threatened—it will coil ready to bite. But the rattler itself cannot hear the noise its own tail makes. Like most snakes, it ‘hears’ things through vibrations in the ground. If a person walks nearby the snake can feel the movement. But if the same person were to shout, it would not hear a thing. Rattlesnakes are very common and widespread animals, living right across the American continent from Canada to Argentina. They feed on a variety of prey, including mice, voles, rats, chipmunks and many other small animals. Rattlesnakes kill their prey with venom. Like all snakes, they swallow the unfortunate animals whole. Few snakes have to eat more than once a week and some, such as the larger pythons, can survive for a year or more without eating"
12537fe78,India,6th,"Another animal which lives in the desert is the camel. Camels were first domesticated by people many thousands of years ago. In the wild, camels usually live in small groups of up to thirty animals. Camels have long, shaggy winter coats to keep warm and shorter, tidier coats in the summer to keep cool. A thirsty camel can drink as much as thirty gallons of water — that’s about five hundred full glasses — in just ten minutes. Normally, however, it gets all the moisture it needs from desert plants and can survive for up to ten months without drinking any water at all. "
965e592c0,India,3rd,"The magic garden was in a school playground. It was very pretty. Sunflowers and roses stood high against the wall. There were also marigolds, poppies and pansies. The sunshine fell on this garden more than on any other and the flowers danced and sang happily. They said to one another, “We have hundreds of little gardeners.” They were the children from the school. One sunny morning the flowers were talking to the birds. “I love all the children, but I love the dear little ones most of all,” said a poppy. “I like them to bring their watering cans and water my thirsty roots.” “Yes,” said the marigolds, “the boys are good to us too. They dig the ground so well!"
9612592c0,India,3rd,"“We love the little children,” said a tiny bird. They are kind and they bring bread for us.” All the flowers said, We must work hard to make our  dresses very pretty, for the children will be here soon.” The sun said, “I will help you also, for nothing pleases me better than to see the children running about in the golden sunshine.” Suddenly, the children came out laughing and singing, and the flowers stopped their songs to listen to them. “Oh, look at the tall sunflower!” said one child, and the sunflower lifted its head very proudly. Another child said, “I love the marigold in its golden dress.” The marigold smiled happily"
